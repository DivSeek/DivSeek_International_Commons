# DivSeek_International_Commons
An Ecosystem of Open Data Resources, Analysis Tools and Best Practices for Plant Genetic Resources (PGR).

The aim of _DivSeek International Commons_ is to act as a focus and hub that will bring together relevant efforts around the world and encourage development and use of open interoperable informational tools for the continuum of PGR curation to end-use. 

The overarching emphasis for inclusion of resources is that they be developed with a view to, and preferably demonstration of, being *generic for a wide range of species/crops*, and that facilitate *interoperability*. Working towards this global goal should increase the return on investment for all concerned.

The DivSeek International Network (https://divseekintl.org) is a global community that connects, combines and communicates expertise among stakeholders engaged in the management1 and characterization2 of plant genetic resources. DivSeek comprises leading researchers and practitioners drawn from a broad base of academic and research institutions, government agencies, and inter-governmental organizations around the world. 

DivSeekâ€™s key role is to facilitate and encourage the open dissemination of information about plant genetic resources and to promote benefit-sharing derived from their use, while respecting indigenous knowledge and the international treaties and conventions established to protect them.
